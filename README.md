## Semi-supervised learning

This is a fork of [`semi_supervised` module from `scikit-learn`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/master/sklearn/semi_supervised) which [fixes some known bugs](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/5774) in the original implementation.

Eventually, the goal is to merge this fork back into `scikit-learn`.
